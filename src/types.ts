 * and only then signed.
 * If you are wrapping another signer tool/library (like Metamask or some other Ethereum wallet), you might not have
 * to do this prefixing manually if you use the `personal_sign` method. Check documentation of the tool!
 * If you are writing your own storage for keys, then you have to prefix the data manually otherwise the Bee node
 * will reject the chunks signed by you!
 *
 * For example see the hashWithEthereumPrefix() function.

 * @property sign     The sign function that can be sync or async. This function takes non-prefixed data. See above.
 * @property address  The ethereum address of the signer in bytes.
